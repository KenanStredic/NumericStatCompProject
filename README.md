# Numerical and Statistical Computing Project

In this project, we delved into various methodologies and algorithms to enhance digit recognition accuracy using the MNIST dataset. Below is an outline of the steps involved in the project:

1. Data Preprocessing:
- Normalization of pixel values to a range of [0, 1]
- Flattening of image matrices into vectors for uniform data representation
  
2. Feature Extraction using Principal Component Analysis (PCA):
- Reduction of dataset dimensionality while preserving variance
- Selection of principal components to enhance computation efficiency and model performance
  
3. Supervised and Semi-Supervised Learning Techniques:
- Utilization of Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm in a semi-supervised learning framework
- Labeling of a subset of data for supervised learning
- Integration of labeled and unlabeled data for comprehensive training set creation
  
4. Model Training and Evaluation:
- Implementation of Random Forest classifier as a benchmark for comparison
- Training of classification models using combined datasets
- Evaluation of model performance through validation losses and accuracy metrics
- Generation of predictions for the test set
  
5. Comparison of Algorithms and Performance Evaluation:
- Assessment of Random Forest, K-means clustering, and Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) accuracies
- Analysis of clustering limitations and challenges
- Highlighting of misclassification patterns and model limitations
  
6. Report Generation:
- Organization of project results into a comprehensive report
- Presentation of findings, including methodology, results, and limitations
- Recommendations for future research and improvement in digit recognition systems
  
Throughout the project, we leveraged programming languages such as R and Python, along with libraries like scikit-learn and PyTorch. Additionally, we employed visualization tools like ggplot2 and TensorBoard for result analysis and interpretation.

This project provides valuable insights into the complexities of digit recognition tasks and underscores the importance of exploring diverse methodologies to enhance model accuracy and efficiency.
